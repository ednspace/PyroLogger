PyrologgerV2

This is an updated version of the old Pyrologger codebase. It will feature a PyQT/QWT GUI interface to a custom hardware control board. The new board will have an upgraded microcontroller, the PIC 16F1827 and a Dallas 1 Wire Bus Master chip and an FTDI serial to USB converter for interaction with the computer.

It is planned to bring out all of the old Pyrologger features but finally move to a more robust hardware platform. There will eventually be software enhancements as well, once all the bugs are worked out with the new hardware. 

I will be keeping Firmware code, GUI code, and board files for the interface board as well as the thermocouple sensors all under this new GIT repository.

As they say, stay tuned!
