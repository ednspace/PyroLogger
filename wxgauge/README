Looks like under Arch at least all you have to do once you get the 
system going is to...
pacman -S python
pacman -S python-pyserial
pacman -S wxpython
pacman -S python-matplotlib

install subversion
pacman -S subversion

checkout the package from your home directory as a normal user
https://pyrologger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyrologger --username 
ednspace

and it opens and runs

Test of current draw with laptop B130 Dell
KillAWatt reports 30 watts .56 amps 119 volts
If we have a 90 amp hour battery. 30/12=2.5 (figure 3 amps for safety)
90 amp hour battery should give 90/3=30 hours of life for logging 1 full day
More time if screen is off.
